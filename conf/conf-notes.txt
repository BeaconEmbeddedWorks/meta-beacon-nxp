### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

Beacon iMX8M sample files are included in this directory as the default build for iMX8M Beacon kit.  
The files are bblayers.conf.sample and local.conf.sample

This means using the  
DISTRO=fsl-xwayland MACHINE=beacon-imx8mm-kit source fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build-dir>

is not necessary and manually adding the custom layers is not necessary.


Using the command
TEMPLATECONF=../sources/meta-beacon-nxp/conf source sources/poky/oe-init-build-env <build-dir>

A script needs to be invoke once to allow user to accept the EULA agreement. It can also be used 
to override the default hardware (beacon-imx8mm-kit)  
 ../sources/meta-beacon-nxp/setup_beacon.sh -m beacon-imx8mm-kit

After these commands are issued the use the bitbake command to build an image for the specified 
platform. 

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

examples:
Common targets are:
bitbake imx-image-full
core-image-minimal
