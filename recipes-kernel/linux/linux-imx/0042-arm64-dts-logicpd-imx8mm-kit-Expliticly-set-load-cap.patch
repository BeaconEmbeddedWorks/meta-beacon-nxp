Subject: [PATCH 42/43] arm64: dts: logicpd-imx8mm-kit: Expliticly set load
 capacitance

With the (mostly) backported driver for the pcf85263/pcf85363,
this patch explitcly sets the capacitance to 12.5pF.  This is
the driver default, but in the event the default changes, this
value should not for this board.

Fixes: PHOENIX8-23
