Subject: [PATCH 23/34] ARM64: dts: Fix GPIO Expander compatible flag

The GPIO expanders on the baseboard are pcal6416A devices which
are software compatbile with the tca6416 when used as outputs, but
when configured as inputs, they are not.

This patch correct sets the compatible flag for the GPIO expanders
to "nxp,pcal6416"
